Leverage Quarto to write the formulas! See: https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html#equations\nYou should also refer to the examples folder in Homework 3.\nNote: distinct queries are those that are entirely different. Counterexample: “Display a list of student last names in alphabetical order” is not distinct from “Display a list of student names and email addresses”. However, “Display a list of student last names in alphabetical order” is distinct from “Who are the five students with the highest GPA?”"
